# Bank_Churners_ML-model
This repository contains a machine learning algorithm that predicts credit card customer churn using a relevant database from a bank. The data is first analyzed using graphs and calculations, and then processed, encoded, and scaled to be modeled using Scikit-learn and other libraries. The algorithm employs several classification models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine, and is evaluated using performance metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and r2 score. 

It is important to note that this repository is intended for educational purposes only.
